0. Development environement is under: ubuntu 16.04 LTS, python 3.6.4
1. Run the script by hiring.py -i [input path] -o [output path]
2. Rememeber to put in a valid output path otherwise the script will quit
3. The script doesn't support pdf version at this time
4. Output json file will be created under the same folder with the script, name 'data.txt'. The output name is hardcoding in the script, if you want to change the name, please edit 'ouput_json_path' parameter in the file
5. Some parameter can be changed to get better result, due to the limited of data, I choose the paramter works well at this time. Please refer to the comments in the code for more information.
6. The script don't support input as a folder at this time.
7.Please let me know if further adjustment need to be done.
